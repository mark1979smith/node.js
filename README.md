node.js
=======
This attempts to show how, being thrown in at the deep end, I can learn new technologies and build, albeit basic, applications.

I chose Node.js because I had heard about it in the last 12-18 months and I was intrigued with Javascript running
on the server.

Not really being a Javascript programmer myself (definately more PHP) I found a great tutorial on http://www.nodebeginner.org/
where I felt I could relate to the author. I found the guidance very helpful.
